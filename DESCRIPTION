Description: netOmics is a multi-omics networks builder and explorer.
    It uses a combination of network inference algorithms and and knowledge-based graphs to build multi-layered networks.
    The package can be combined with timeOmics to incorporate time-course expression data and build sub-networks from multi-omics kinetic clusters.
    Finally, from the generated multi-omics networks, propogation analyses allow the identification of missing biological functions (1), 
    multi-omics mechanisms (2) and molecules between kinetic clusters (3). This helps to resolve complex regulatory mechanisms.
