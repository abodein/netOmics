# netOmics

With netOmics, we go beyond integration by introducing an interpretation tool.
netOmics is a package for the creation and exploration of multi-omics networks.

Depending on the provided dataset, it allows to create inference networks from expression data but also interaction networks from knowledge databases.
After merging the sub-networks to obtain a global multi-omics network, we propose network exploration methods using propoagation techniques to perform functional prediction or identification of molecular mechanisms.

Furthermore, the package has been developed for longitudinal multi-omics data and can be used in conjunction with our previously published package timeOmics.
